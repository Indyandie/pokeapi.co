<h2 id="info">Information</h2>
<p>
    This is a <strong>consumption-only</strong> API — only the
    HTTP GET method is available on resources.
</p>
<p>
    No authentication is required to access this API, and all
    resources are fully open and available. Since the move to
    static hosting in November 2018, rate limiting has been
    removed entirely, but we still encourage you to limit the
    frequency of requests to limit our hosting costs.
</p>
{/* <p>
    If you are going to be regularly using the API, we recommend
    caching data on your service or deploying your own instance
    of the API (jump on{' '}
